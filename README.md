### Sales Data-Analysis
# Introduction
The aim of this project is to combine all sales data for the year 2019 and help us understand and solve some business problems.
Some of the questions we seek answers to are;
1. The best Sales Month and the amount of money earned in that month
2. What City has the highest number of Sales?
3. What time should we display advertisements to maximize the likelihood of customers buying product?
